map, filter, lambda
map: The map() function applies a function to every member of iterable and returns the result. If there are multiple arguments, map() returns a list consisting of tuples containing the corresponding items from all iterables.
filter:  It takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence for which the function returned True.
lambda: Python provides the ability to create a simple (no statements allowed internally) anonymous inline function called lambda function. Using lambda and map you can have two for loops in one line.
